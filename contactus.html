		<p>The <em>Charlotte's Web</em> is the first English novel I read. I enjoy it anytime when I read it at my Mac, my smartphone, my Kindle, or this website.</p>
		<p>Charlotte’s Web is a children’s novel by American author E. B. White and illustrated by Garth Williams. It was published in October 15, 1952, by Harper & Brothers. The novel tells the story of a pig named Wilbur and his friendship with a barn spider named Charlotte. When Wilbur is in danger of being slaughtered by the farmer, Charlotte writes messages praising Wilbur (like "Some Pig") in her web in order to persuade the farmer to let him live. </p>

		<p>The genre of this novel is Children’s. However, adults also can enjoy it as well as children. This website project only covers the first 5 chapters (from the birthing of Wilbur to the meeting of Wilbur and Charlotte) due to the limited time of designing it. </p>
